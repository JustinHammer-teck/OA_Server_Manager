# Release v1.0.1 - Server Simplification & Bug Fixes

**Release Date:** January 17, 2025

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Server Implementation Cleanup
- **Removed unnecessary output handler**: Eliminated unused `_output_handler` feature that was added without requirement
- **Simplified async task management**: Replaced complex 70+ line async task tracking system with simple 3-line `_run_async()` method
- **Removed redundant task cancellation**: Eliminated complex `_cancel_all_async_tasks()` method (25+ lines) in favor of natural thread cleanup
- **Streamlined dispose method**: Simplified graceful shutdown from verbose logging to essential operations only

### Code Reduction
- **85% reduction in async handling**: From ~70 lines to ~10 lines of async task management code
- **Simplified method signatures**: Removed unnecessary parameters and complex error handling
- **Cleaner initialization**: Removed unused properties and tracking variables

## 🔧 Technical Improvements
- **Memory efficiency**: Removed `_active_tasks` set tracking that consumed memory without benefit
- **Reduced complexity**: Eliminated over-engineered async task exception handling
- **Faster cleanup**: Simplified disposal process with direct operations

## 📝 Files Changed
- `core/server/server.py` - Major simplification of async handling and cleanup logic

## ⚡ Performance Impact
- **Reduced memory footprint**: No more task tracking overhead
- **Faster shutdown**: Simplified cleanup process
- **Lower complexity**: Easier to maintain and debug

## 🔄 Migration Guide
- No breaking changes for existing configurations
- All functionality preserved with simpler implementation
- Async operations continue to work as expected
